# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience – Forage
A data science project completed as part of the British Airways Job Simulation on Forage (May 2025). This project simulates real-world airline business challenges and demonstrates how data science can support customer experience, operational decisions, and targeted marketing.

📌 Project Overview
The objective of this simulation was to analyze customer behavior and use predictive modeling to help British Airways optimize lounge usage and improve marketing strategies.

✅ Tasks Completed: <br>
  - Scraped and analyzed customer review data.<br>
  - Used Excel to categorize flights and estimate lounge eligibility.<br>
  - Built a machine learning classification model to predict customer booking behavior.<br>
  - Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and interpreted the results.<br>
  - Presented insights and recommendations to a hypothetical manager using PowerPoint.<br>

  📊 Technologies Used:
1. Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
2. Excel (pivot tables, formulas)
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. PowerPoint (for stakeholder presentation)

📌 Project Summary

🔍 Key Findings:
  - The predictive model achieved 85% accuracy, indicating strong ability to identify patterns in booking behavior.<br>
  - Feature importance analysis revealed that flight destination, booking origin, and flight timing were major predictors of booking likelihood.<br>
  - Precision was moderate (0.505), but recall was low (0.137) — the model correctly identified only a small portion of actual bookers.<br>
  - Lounge eligibility estimation revealed that certain flight categories (e.g., long-haul international or premium routes) had significantly higher lounge usage potential.<br>

✅ Recommendations:
  - I suggest adding more customer-centric features to improve recall and capture more potential bookers for proactive outreach.<br>
